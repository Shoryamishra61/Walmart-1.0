## Troubleshooting (Manual Setup)

If you are running services without Docker, ensure you:
- Manually create the PostgreSQL database and user as described above.
- Use the correct, URL-encoded password in your DATABASE_URL (e.g., Sonu123456%23%40 for Sonu123456#@).
- Start each backend service in its own terminal window.
- If you encounter connection errors, check that PostgreSQL is running and accessible on port 5432.
